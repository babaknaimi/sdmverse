description: "ENMTML is a package to create and
      process Ecological Niche Models. The main
      purpose of this package is to assemble all this
      methodological complexity spread over several
      papers and bring it into the spotlight in a
      simple way for people not used to the details
      of ENMs. The package contains several
      alternatives to different methodological steps,
      e.g., pseudo-absence allocation and accessible
      area delimitation, formulated within a single
      function, to make it accessible for people not
      used to the programming environment."
