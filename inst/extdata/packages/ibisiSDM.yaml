description: "The ibis.iSDM package provides a series of convenience functions
to fit integrated Species Distribution Models (iSDMs). With integrated models
we generally refer to SDMs that incorporate information from different
biodiversity datasets, external parameters such as priors or offsets with
respect to certain variables and regions. It is highly modular and contains
several helper functions to facilitate model inference and projection, as well as
wrappers to other existing models."
