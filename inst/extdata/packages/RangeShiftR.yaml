description: "RangeShiftR provides individual-based simulations of spatial eco-evolutionary dynamics. It is based on the C++ software RangeShifter, making it flexible and fast. RangeShiftR models the processes of demography, dispersal and evolution in an inter-dependent way, offering substantial complexity in the corresponding modelling choices. It is entirely open-source and aims to facilitate the application of individual-based and mechanistic modelling to eco-evolutionary questions."
