description: "Allows to map species richness and endemism based on stacked
    species distribution models (SSDM). Individuals SDMs can be created using a
    single or multiple algorithms (ensemble SDMs). For each species, an SDM can
    yield a habitat suitability map, a binary map, a between-algorithm variance
    map, and can assess variable importance, algorithm accuracy, and between-
    algorithm correlation. Methods to stack individual SDMs include summing
    individual probabilities and thresholding then summing. Thresholding can be
    based on a specific evaluation metric or by drawing repeatedly from a Bernoulli
    distribution. The SSDM package also provides a user-friendly interface."
