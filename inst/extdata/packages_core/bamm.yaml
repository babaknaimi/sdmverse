description: "Species Distribution Modeling (SDM) is a practical methodology
 that aims to estimate the area of distribution of a species. However,
 most of the work has focused on estimating static expressions of the
 correlation between environmental variables. The outputs of
 correlative species distribution models can be interpreted
 as maps of the suitable environment for a species but not generally as maps
 of its actual distribution.
 Soberón and Peterson (2005) <doi:10.17161/bi.v2i0.4> presented
 the BAM scheme, a heuristic framework that states that the occupied area of
 a species occurs on sites that have been accessible through dispersal (M) and
 have both favorable biotic (B) and abiotic conditions (A).
 The 'bamm' package implements classes and functions to operate on each element
 of the BAM and by using a cellular automata model where the occupied area
 of a species at time t is estimated by the multiplication of three
 binary matrices: one matrix represents movements (M), another
 abiotic -niche- tolerances (A), and a third, biotic interactions (B).
 The theoretical background of the package can be found in
 Soberón and Osorio-Olvera (2022) <arXiv:2212.06308>."
