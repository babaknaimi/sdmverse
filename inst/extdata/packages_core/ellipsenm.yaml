description: "A collection of tools to characterize ecological niches using
ellipsoid envelopes. Functions to perform model calibration and selection,
prepare model projections to distinct scenarios, assess niche overlap, and
produce virtual ecological niches are included as part of this package.
Other functions implemented here are useful to perform a series of common
pre- and post-modeling analyses. In contrast to other tools for ecological
niche and species distribution modeling, this package is the first in
presenting a comprehensive set of tools that use ellipsoid envelopes as
the theoretical representation of ecological niches. Details on the
theoretical background and methods used here can be found in:
