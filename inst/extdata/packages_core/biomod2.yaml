description: "Functions for species distribution modeling, calibration
and evaluation, ensemble of models, ensemble forecasting and visualization.
The package permits to run consistently up to 10 single models on a
presence/absences (resp presences/pseudo-absences) dataset and to combine
them in ensemble models and ensemble projections. Some bench of other
evaluation and visualisation tools are also available within the package."
